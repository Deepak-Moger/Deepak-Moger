# 👾 Hey, I’m Deepak 

### Interrogating data until it confesses 🕵️‍♂️📊

I’m a relentless **Machine Learning Engineer** & **Data Storyteller**.
I don’t just train models; I teach them to think. My journey involves turning raw, chaotic datasets into precise predictions and actionable intelligence. While others see rows and columns, I see vectors waiting to be aligned.

Whether I'm analyzing drift in cloud infrastructure or predicting the future of a match, I build systems that don't just process data—they understand it.

🔭 **Current Status:** Refining the signal, filtering the noise.
🧠 **Philosophy:** If the data looks too good to be true, it's probably overfitting.

### 🔬 What’s Brewing in the Lab?

My current experiments pushing the boundaries of ML:
* 🔮 **Predictive Modeling:** Building high-performance models for **Match Outcome Prediction**—because intuition is good, but probability is better.
* 🗣️ **NVIDIA Riva Integration:** Engineering a real-time **Voice-to-Voice Translation** system to break language barriers at the speed of sound.
* ☁️ **Infrastructure Intelligence:** Researching **AI-based Drift Detection** to catch cloud anomalies before they become catastrophes.
* 📈 **Restaurant Analytics:** Using regression algorithms to determine what really drives a 5-star rating.
